This package provides adapters for common data model classes related to coordinates and
measurements. Note that at the time of this writing the VOTable parser is already astropy-aware, and it returns
astropy quantities and columns whenever possible.

The adapters in this module take it to the next level and provide a seamless bridge from standard model objects to
astropy objects. The adapters are applied on the fly when parsing a standard object, if the standard model class
is decorated with the :py:class:`~rama.utils.Adapter` decorator, which accepts the adapter class as an argument.

For example::

    >>> from rama.utils import Adapter
    >>> from rama.registry import VO
    >>> from rama.framework import Attribute
    >>> class MyAdapter:
    ...     def __init__(self, standard_obj):
    ...         self.ultimate = standard_obj.standard_attribute
    >>> @VO("some:id")
    ... @Adapter(MyAdapter)
    ... class MyStandard:
    ...     standard_attribute = Attribute('foo:bar')

Every time the parser will build an instance of the ``Standard`` class, it will pass it to the `Adapter` class::

    >>> from io import StringIO
    >>> xml = StringIO('''<INSTANCE dmtype="some:id">
    ... <ATTRIBUTE dmrole="foo:bar">
    ...   <LITERAL dmtype="ivoa:integer" value="42"/>
    ... </ATTRIBUTE>
    ... </INSTANCE>
    ... ''')
    >>> from rama import read
    >>> parsed = read(xml).find_instances(MyStandard)[0]
    >>> print(type(parsed))
    <class '....MyAdapter'>
    >>> print(parsed.ultimate)
    42

There are no restrictions on how the adapter needs to be implemented. In the above example it simply implement a
regular Python initializer method to initialize itself with data from the standard object. In other cases
adapters might implement the ``__new__`` method and return a completely different object.
